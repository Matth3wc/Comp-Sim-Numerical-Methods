    "1. Would there be an advantage in using a numpy array for x_values?\n",
    "   \n",
    "   YES - Advantages:\n",
    "   - Better performance for numerical operations\n",
    "   - More memory efficient for large datasets\n",
    "   - Built-in vectorized operations\n",
    "   - Better integration with matplotlib\n",
    "   \n",
    "   However, in this specific case with only 20 iterations, the difference \n",
    "   is negligible. For larger simulations, numpy arrays are strongly preferred.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Is there any way to remove the for loop using a vector form for x_values?\n",
    "   \n",
    "   NO - Not easily in this case because:\n",
    "   - Each iteration depends on the result of the previous iteration\n",
    "   - The logistic map is inherently sequential: x_{n+1} = f(x_n)\n",
    "   - This is a recurrence relation that must be computed step-by-step\n",
    "   - Vectorization is not applicable for dependent sequences\n",
    "   \n",
    "   However, we COULD vectorize if we wanted to compute multiple independent\n",
    "   trajectories simultaneously (different initial conditions in parallel).\n",
